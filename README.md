A Drag and Drop Provisioning System


Synopsis
--------

This is a web GUI which allows a user to provision Docker containers across a distributed system by use
of drag and drop.  When connected to a suitable message bus, it is capable of spinning up new docker containers
on individual VMs in a cluster.


Getting Started
---------------

Currently this is a work in progress and requires a pre-provisioned cluster to do anything at all.  If you'd
like to attempt to use this on top of your existing cluster, good luck!
